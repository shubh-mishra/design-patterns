# 🔒 Singleton Pattern – Practice Scenarios

The **Singleton Pattern** ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It is commonly used when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system.

---

## ✅ Recap: What is the Singleton Pattern?

- **Purpose**: Restrict instantiation of a class to one object.
- **Problem Solved**: Control shared access to resources or configurations.
- **Key Benefit**: Centralized control, memory efficiency.

---

## 🧪 Practice Scenarios

### 1. 🛠️ Configuration Manager

**Description**: Create a singleton class that loads and holds application configuration values from a file or environment variables.

```python
config = ConfigManager()
print(config.get("API_KEY"))
```

---

### 2. 🧾 Logger Utility

**Description**: Ensure that all parts of the application use the same logger instance to write to a single file or output stream.

```python
logger = Logger()
logger.log("This is a log message")
```

---

### 3. 🗃️ Database Connection Pool

**Description**: Manage a single shared connection pool to the database, reused throughout the app.

```python
db = DatabaseConnection.get_instance()
db.query("SELECT * FROM users")
```

---

### 4. ⏰ Scheduler / Job Manager

**Description**: A singleton that maintains a queue of scheduled tasks or jobs to run periodically.

```python
scheduler = JobScheduler()
scheduler.schedule("backup", interval=3600)
```

---

### 5. 🔐 Authentication Session Manager

**Description**: Singleton that manages login state or tokens for user sessions in a desktop or mobile app.

```python
session = SessionManager()
session.login("user", "pass")
```

---

### 6. 📦 Cache System

**Description**: Centralized caching system used across multiple parts of the application to store computed or fetched results.

```python
cache = Cache.get_instance()
cache.set("user:1", {"name": "Alice"})
```

## 🧠 Self-Check: Have You Mastered It?

- ✅ Does your singleton class restrict instantiation to one object?
- ✅ Are all parts of the code accessing the same instance?
- ✅ Have you handled thread safety in multithreaded contexts (if needed)?
- ✅ Can you easily replace or reset the singleton for testing?
- ✅ Are you avoiding overuse of the pattern (which can lead to tight coupling)?

If your answer is **yes** to all – you’re on the right track!
